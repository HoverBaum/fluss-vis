# Copilot Instructions

- We prefer TypeScript over JavaScript.
- We prefer `const functionName = () => {}` over `function(){}`.
- Our React components always use named exports.
- We import members of React. Instead of using React.useEffect or React.useState, we prefer to directly import useEffect and useState, etc.
