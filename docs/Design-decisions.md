# Design decisions

This document keeps track of design decisions made.
Each decision has a date, decision text and optionally a description.

## 2025-03-10 Doubleclick to edit

We remove the Edit button on Nodes in favor of Double Clicking to open edit.
This leads to a more streamlined design with the assumption that double click to edit is intuitive - thus we need no explicit "edit button".

## 2025-02-26 Button variants

We will use `outline` buttons for things that can be picked from a list.

`primary` should be use sparingly and not for always visible UI elements of the Editor.

`secondary` should be used for always visible UI elements.

`ghost` will not be used!
