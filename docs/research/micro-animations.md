# Micro Animations

Would be great to add some juice to the application. Some small things happen, when users take actions.

Small lib: https://react.useanimations.com/

Motion, animate elements in React https://motion.dev/

Lottie files: https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react
ChatGPt can create Lottie files.

In `/lottie` are two ChatGPT generated files. one.json is a blinking circle and two.json is circles flying out from a central point.
