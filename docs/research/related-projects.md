These projects somehow relate to Fluss-Viz.

**https://n8n.io/**
A visual programming tool for AI flows. I love how it visualizes during runtime. But it moves the entire programming to a visual layer and enforces a way of thinking for flow controls. We want to be more abstract, just doing flow orchestration and leave programming to code.

**https://mastra.ai/**
Framework targeted as TypeScript users. You can build logic in code and have it visualized before running it. Almost where we want to be but we we want the visual to be the starting point and not just a checkpoint.

LangChain
Python based solution that is great in sharing common logic - focussed on AI use cases. This struggles immensely with type safety. Also visualization features are paid.
