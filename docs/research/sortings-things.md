# Sorting things

We probably want to sort inputs and outputs at some point. Likely drag and drop and not just buttons up and down. Biggest design challenge: where to place the element (up down arrow or drag handle).

https://dndkit.com/ seems promissing for drag and drop. Especially since it provides a sortable preset: https://docs.dndkit.com/presets/sortable.

See minimal example here, comparing it to native drag and drop: https://shadcn-drag-and-drop.vercel.app/.
