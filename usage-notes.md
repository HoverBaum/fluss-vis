# Usage

Things we or users notice during usage so we can improve upon them.

- Array types are weird. It feels clunky to have to define a type and an array type. Maybe array could be a flag?
- Deleting a type leads to a blank page -> should probably direct to start page of types.
- There should always be a "save to" button.
- The .fluss.ts could have a hin about how to use it. Devs might forget and this would enable GenAI agents to pick up what to do as long, as users add the .fluss.ts to their context.
- we need Alpha labels.
- opening a Fluss should zoom editor to fit
